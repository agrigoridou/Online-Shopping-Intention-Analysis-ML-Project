# Online Shopping Intention Analysis — Machine Learning Project

This project analyzes user behavior in an online shopping environment and predicts whether a customer will finalize a purchase based on session data.
Using Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and visual analytics, we build and evaluate predictive models to understand the factors that influence buying intentions.
